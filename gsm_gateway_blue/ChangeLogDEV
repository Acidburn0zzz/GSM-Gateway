	1 -->   ATH                || HANGUP REQ ||
	1 <-- 0 NO CARRIER         || HANGUP REQ || last sent ATH
	1 <-- 0 OK                 || READY      || last sent ATH

	* In chan_allogsm while handling ALLOGSM_EVENT_PROCEEDING,
	AST_CONTROL_PROGRESS is sent instead of AST_CONTROL_PROCEEDING so that call
	proceeding tones coming from GSM can be fed as early media on other side.

	bug is fixed.
	* Provision to redirect call to asterisk if we dont receive Caller ID
	is done. Calls without Caller ID will now be sent as UNKNOWN Call.
